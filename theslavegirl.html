							<h1>The Slave Girl Book Review</h1>
				<p> <img src="images/theslavegirl.jpg" width="350px"><br>The story of Ogbanje Ojebeta starts at her birth in 1909, although it is intricately woven to that of her parents going back to the turn of century when Nigeria was still part of the Portuguese Empire. Of course colonial parentage meant nothing to the people in the land and they were oblivious to what happened to the ownership of their country.

When English administrators were beaten out of the troublesome town of Ibuza by the stubborn Ibos and the invincible malaria mosquitoes in 1909, Okwekwu made his name by rescuing a sick English District Officer, carrying him on his back to the DO’s headquarters in Ogwashi-Ukwu. The resultant reward as court messenger added ‘Oda’ to Okwenkwu’s name for he could never pronounce the English word ‘order’ as required in the court.

It was the year his wife gave birth to a girl that did not die like the previous girls born to Umeadi. Ojebeta’s story is much influenced by what happened in the world those days.

In 1916, a German gas attack made her into an orphan. Her elder brother, Owezim, had already left to do ‘the white man’s work’ leaving her younger, lazier brother, Okolie, to the task of taking care of her. He wasted no time and sold her into slavery to a wealthy relative.

The stay with the relative for nearly nine years was, apart from the hard work and degrading discovery of treatment as a slave, quite uplifting. Ojebta was taught far more refined manners than she would have if she had stayed in Ibuza. The death of her owner/benefactor caused some agonizing moments, which she fortunately escaped. She could not escape tradition, however, because once she was back among her relatives, she was reduced to a mere object of possession, despite her refined manners.

When true love knocked on her door, she had but one last hurdle to take to become really free, although women are never really free in Africa. In line with the dictates of tradition, she was bought off from the Palagada family and could finally belong to her husband.
